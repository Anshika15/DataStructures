Stock Span

1. You are given a number n, representing the size of array a.
2. You are given n numbers, representing the prices of a share on n days.
3. You are required to find the stock span for n days.
4. Stock span is defined as the number of days passed between the current day and the first day before today when price was higher than today.

e.g.
for the array [2 5 9 3 1 12 6 8 7]
span for 2 is 1
span for 5 is 2
span for 9 is 3
span for 3 is 1
span for 1 is 1
span for 12 is 6
span for 6 is 1
span for 8 is 2
span for 7 is 1
